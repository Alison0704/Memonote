I am excited to share with you some recent changes I am making to enhance my development approach and productivity. As a software developer, it is crucial to maintain a structured thought process and efficiently manage feature implementation. To achieve this, I will be implementing a more disciplined approach to my development process.
In the past, I have found myself struggling with a scattered focus, often driven by the fear of overlooking potential features that could be integrated into our application. This kind of scattered focus can hinder productivity and impact the quality of decision-making.
To address this issue, I am committed to limiting the number of features I work on simultaneously to a manageable range of 2-3 at a time. This focused approach will allow me to channel my energy and attention more effectively into the tasks at hand and ensure that each feature receives the dedication it deserves. I will also adopt a practice of reviewing and considering additional features only once the current set is completed. This approach will help prevent feature creep and ensure that we maintain a stable and maintainable codebase.
It is essential to note that I will be taking a measured and deliberate approach to this transition, starting with small, manageable steps to prevent overwhelming the application. This way, I can gradually implement these changes without causing any disruptions to the ongoing development process.
Additionally,I am currently enrolled in a software course focusing on UML (Unified Modeling Language) and design patterns. This course will equip me with valuable tools and insights that will further enhance my development capabilities. The knowledge gained from this course will be applied to our projects, resulting in improved project prioritization and a more streamlined development process.
